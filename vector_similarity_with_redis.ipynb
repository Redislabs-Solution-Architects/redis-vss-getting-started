    "Today, about 80% of the data organizations generate is \"unstructured\"; data that either does not have a well-defined schema or cannot be restructured into a familiar columnar format. Typical examples of unstructured data include free-form text, images, videos, and sound clips. Moreover, this data imbalance towards unstructured data is expected to grow in the coming decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unstructured data is high-dimensional and noisy,    making it more challenging to analyze and interpret using traditional methods. But it is also packed with information and meaning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, unstructured data is processed to extract specific features, effectively turning it into structured data. Once in the realm of structured data, we can search the data with SQL queries (if stored in a relational database) or with a text search engine. \n",
    "The approach of transforming unstructured data into structured data has a few issues; first, engineering features out of unstructured data can be computationally expensive and error-prone, significantly delaying when we can effectively use the data. And secondly, in the extractions/transformation process, lose fidelity and information since unique, 'latent' features are likely lost or overlooked because they can't be easily categorized or quantified."

    "An approach to dealing with unstructured data is to \"vectorize\" such data. By \"vectorizing,\" we mean to somehow convert something like a text passage, an image, a video, or a song into a flat sequence of numbers representing a particular piece of data. These \"vectors\" are representations of the data in N-dimensional space. By vectorizing, we gain the ability to use linear algebra techniques to compare, group, and operate on our data. This is the foundation of a Vector Database; the ability to store and operate on vectors.\n",

    "Traditional methods for converting unstructured data into vector form include Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for textual data. For categorical data, one-hot Encoding is a commonly used approach. And Hashing and Feature Extraction techniques, such as edge detection, texture analysis, or color histograms, have been employed for high-dimensionality data like images.\n",
    "\n",
    "While powerful in their own right, these approaches reveal limitations when confronted with high-dimensional and intricate data forms like long text passages, images, and audio. Consider, for example, how a text passage could be restructured—through sentence rearrangement, synonym usage, or alterations in narrative style. Such Simple modifications could effectively sidestep techniques like Bag-of-Words, preventing systems using the generated encodings from identifying texts with similar meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where advancements in Machine Learning, particularly Deep Learning, make their mark. Machine Learning models have facilitated the rise of 'embeddings' as a widely embraced method for generating dense, low-dimensional vector representations. Given a suitable model for the task at hand, the generated embeddings can encapsulate complex patterns and semantic meanings inherent in data, thus overcoming the limitations of their traditional counterparts."

The Jigger is a 12 inch lightweight kids bicycle and it will meet your little one\\u2019s need for speed. It\\u2019s a single speed bike that makes learning to pump pedals simple and intuitive. It even has  a handle in the bottom of the saddle so you can easily help your child during training!  The Jigger is among the most lightweight children\\u2019s bikes on the planet. It is designed so that 2-3 year-olds fit comfortably in a molded ride position that allows for efficient riding, balanced handling and agility. The Jigger\\u2019s frame design and gears work together so your buddingbiker can stand up out of the seat, stop rapidly, rip over trails and pump tracks. The Jigger\\u2019s is amazing on dirt or pavement. Your tike will speed down the bike path in no time. The Jigger will ship with a coaster brake. A freewheel kit is provided at no cost. \"\n",

Fat Kenda Booster tires give you grip in corners and on wet trails. The Shimano Tourney drivetrain offered enough gears for finding a comfortable pace to ride uphill, and the Tektro hydraulic disc brakes break smoothly. Whether you want an affordable bike that you can take to work, but also take trail riding on the weekends or you\\u2019re just after a stable, comfortable ride for the bike path, the Summit gives a good value for money.\",\n",

    "- 2️⃣ The keys being indexed are found using the `bikes:` key prefix.\n",

    "- 6️⃣ The `$.price` field will be indexed as a `NUMERIC` allowing numeric range queries.\n",
    "- 7️⃣ The `$.type` field will be indexed as a `TAG` field. Tag fields allow exact-match queries, and are suitable for categorical values.\n",
    "- 8️⃣ The `$.description` field will also be indexed as a `TEXT` field.\n",

    "* `FLAT`: Specifies the indexing method, which can be `FLAT` or `HNSW`. FLAT (brute-force indexing) provides exact results but at a higher computational cost, while HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) is a more efficient method that provides approximate results with lower computational overhead.\n",
    "* `TYPE`: Set to `FLOAT32`. Current supported types are `FLOAT32` and `FLOAT64`.\n",
    "* `DIM`: The length or dimension of our embeddings, which we determined previously to be `1536` or `768`.\n",
    "* `DISTANCE_METRIC`: One of `L2`, `IP`, `COSINE`. \n",
    "  - `L2` stands for \"Euclidean distance\"; a straight-line distance between the vectors. Preferred when the absolute differences, including magnitude, matter most.\n",
    "  - `IP` stands for \"Inner Product\"; IP measures the projection of one vector onto another. It emphasizes the angle between vectors rather than their absolute positions in the vector space.\n",
    "  - `COSINE` stands for \"Cosine Similarity\"; a normalized form of inner product. This metric measures only the angle between two vectors, making it magnitude-independent.  \n",
    "  - For our querying purposes, the direction of the vectors carries more meaning (indicating semantic similarity), and the magnitude is largely influenced by the length of the documents, therefore `COSINE` similarity is chosen. Also, our chosen embedding model is fine-tuned for Cosine Similarity."
